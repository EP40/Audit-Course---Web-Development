# Audit-Course---Web-Development
In Assignment 1, I've created 4 pages using HTML and basic CSS. 

Page 1 - Index
  This page is the homepage of the website, which gives a basic idea on what the website is about and I've created it with the help oF HTML. 
  It contains the basic CSS which I've used to create the navbar and footer of the website. From this page you can navigate to all the other pages and back. 
Page 2 - About 
  This page is where you get to know details about the website. I've used HTML and CSS and linked the navbar with this page.
